To install the XenClient tools for Linux, open a terminal window, change
to this directory and execute:

 $ sudo ./install.sh

The various PV drivers can be excluded from the install using the following:

 $ sudo XC_TOOLS_EXCLUDE=vusb,argo ./install.sh

This would prevent both the vusb and argo PV drivers from being insalled.

Possible values for XC_TOOLS_EXCLUDE: argo xenmou vusb
